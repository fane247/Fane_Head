##detailed instructions

Each player is aiming to get rid of all of thier cards. the play who fails to do this is the shit head.  each player must put a card higher than what is on the board

Each player is dealt 3 cards face down, three face up on top of the face down cards and three into thier hand. At this point in time they can swap their face up cards for any in thier hand. click to highlight the cards in your hand and faceup cards and click swap to swap and click ready when you are happy.  You would want to have your highest cards as your face up cards.

Once both players are happy with thier face up cards player 1 gets to play a card in the middle.  highlight the card you want and click ready to play it into the middle.

Players can play more than one card if they have the same rank i.e 3 queen's.

If you cannot play a card higher than the one in the middle you must pick them up by clicking on them.  the turn is then passed to the other player

each player will automatically draw cards if they have less than 3 cards in thier hand until ther are no more cards.

in the deck. At this point once you have used all cards in your hand you can move onto your face up cards.

Once all face up cards have been played you can play one face down card at a time.

If a player can play all thier cards they are the winner!

##extensions 

The original game has power cards which burn the pack, reset to 2 and also are see-through. Given more time. I would also like to add animations and sound effects to cards being played.
