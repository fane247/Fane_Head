#cheat

##overview

a card game where all cards are dealt out evenly into each players hand. should be played with at least 3 players. player left to the dealer start and dealer position shifts round to the left after each game. the aim of the game is to get rid of all cards first.

the first player can put any card or cards of the same rank in one turn face down(i.e 3 queens') and annouce what card they put down. the next player must then put at least one card which is 1 up or 1 down from the rank of the first card(s) played. 

However, in this game you have the option to cheat and say different cards to the one you played. once the cheating player have played thier turn the other players in the game have the option to call them out as a cheat. If they are correct and the player has indeed been decitful the cheating player picks up all the face down cards in the middle. If the accused player was telling the truth, the accuser must pick up all cards in the middle.
