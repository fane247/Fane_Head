# Shit Head

##Overview

each player is aiming to get rid of all of thier cards. the play who fails to do this is the shit head. each player must put a card higher than what is on the board or a **power card**. suits don't apply in this game.

###details

each player is dealt 3 cards **face down**, three **face up** on top of the face down cards and three into thier hand. at this point in time they can swap their face up cards for any in thier hand, but they must have 3 face up cards before to continue.

once both players are happy with thier face up cards the game begins. the player with the lowest card excluding 2 starts (usually a 3).

once the lowest card has been played the oposing player must play a card higher than that which is on the board or a **power card**. Power cards can be played on any card on the board.

players can play more than one card if they have the same rank i.e 3 queen's. If a player plays 4 of a kind this burns the pack (like the power card 10).

each player must draw a card after thier go if they have less than 3 cards in thier hand.

once all cards from the deck have been drawn the player can use up thier remaining cards in thier hand and then move on to their **face up** cards. The player can, as in normal game play, play more than one card from thier **face up** cards if they are the same rank. And again if they pick up from the board they must first get rid of all cards in thier hand before they can play thier **face up** cards.

Once all **face up** cards are played the player can play **one** of thier **face down** cards. this is now pure luck to wether you can play a winning card or not. 

power cards:

* 2 - resets to 2.
* J - see through (board is now last value played before the J).
* 10 - burns the pack (all cards on the board are moved to burn pile and are out of the game.

non-power special cards:

* 7 - next card must be a 7 or lower.

if a player can't place a card higher (or in the case of a 7 lower than) or equal to the current board and does not have a power card to play they must pick up all cards on the board. then the turn passes to the other player.

## considerations

this will be build as a two player game but if I get time I will try to impliment a computer AI. If i'm feeling cocky i'll use a minimax algorith to make an unbeatable computer AI.

If i get the bare bones of the game complete i will add animations and sounds to moves, special animations and sounds for powercards/special cards and if I have time change in view when getting to **face up** and **face down cards** (my inital thought for **face down** cards would be a dim the lights effect and possible a spot light on the cards as you hover. if possible music from who wants to be a millionaire at this point)
